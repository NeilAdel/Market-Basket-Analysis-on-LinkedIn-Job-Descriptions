# Market-Basket-Analysis-on-LinkedIn-Job-Descriptions

This repository contains the code and report for the course project "Implementation of Market Basket Analysis on LinkedIn Jobs & Skills Dataset using Apache Spark." The project focuses on identifying frequent itemsets and generating association rules from job skills data scraped from LinkedIn. The «LinkedIn Jobs & Skills» dataset is used for this purpose which is published on Kaggle and released under the ODC-By license, Version 1.0.

# Contents
Report: The detailed report (AMD_project_report.pdf) explains the methodology, data preprocessing steps, algorithm implementation, results, and conclusions.

Code: The Python scripts (MarketBasketAnalysis.ipynb) used for data preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and result visualization are provided in the code directory.

Results: Consisting of algorithms output in .csv files and also visualizations as .png files.

# Key Findings
Frequent skills identified include communication, customer service, and teamwork.
Association rules reveal interdependencies between various skills, highlighting valuable skill combinations.
